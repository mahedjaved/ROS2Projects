[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstd.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "std", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "std" with any of
  the following names:

    stdConfig.cmake
    std-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "std" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "std_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "std" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
